# **Cloud Architecture**

### **Computer**

1. **Compute:** The Central Processing Unit (CPU) fetches, decodes, and executes instructions from programs and applications.
2. **Storage:** Used to store data and files, the Hard Drive is used for long-term storage, while RAM is used for short-term storage.
3. **Network:** The Network Interface Card allows to connect and communicate with external servers, networks, and the internet.
4. **Software:** Using what we interact with our computers OS + UI (Mac, Windows, Linux), Applications (Files, Browsers, Utility tools)

### **On-Premise Servers**
- Servers are monitor less computers used to power on premise networks.
- Local computers submit a query to the servers database and the server processes the query and returns the data to your computer.
- Servers are ideal place to store databases as compared to a local personal computer.
- Servers have increased computing power, greater storage capacity, and can be accessed by multiple users at a same time.
- Servers have the same components as personal computers, but tend to be physically larger and more powerful.
- Servers entail expensive investments in physical space and hardware (racks, wires, blades, ACs, cooling equipments, etc)
- Requires specialized talent to setup, configure, maintain, service over time to keep it safe and secure.
- Additional investment is needed to ensure data is backed-up and performance remains high.
