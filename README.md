# **Cloud Computing**

### **Cloud 101**

- The cloud is a network of remote servers hosted on the internet used to store, manage, and process data.
- The cloud can be referred to as Hardware (hard drives, processors) and Applications (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365).
- The cloud can be referred to as databases (Snowflake, Databricks) and coding environments (Colab, VSCode, Project IDX, Sqliteonline) 
- The cloud can be referred to as a learning platform (Udemy, LinkedIn, etc) and entertainment platform (YouTube, Netflix, Hotstar, etc)

### Why do we choose the cloud?
- The cloud serves as an extension of computing resources and allows individuals and companies to work on massive computing resources.
- It reduces the dependency on local computing systems, equipment, maintenance, servicing and infrastructure.
- We don't have to think about increasing the storage, memory, or processor. Everything is handled by the cloud service provider.
- We don't have to worry about resource configurations and updates, it can scale up and down according to need.
- Example: YouTube and Undemy, Because of live streaming, we don't need to download any content on our local system.
- Easy access to data stored on the cloud helps Data Engineers, Data Scientists, and Data Analyst to collaborate remotely at the same time.
- Integration of the cloud with Business Intelligence is helping us with immediate decisions, on-demand solutions, and advanced analytics.
- We don't need to transition completely to the cloud, the cloud can be used as an extension (hybrid) to our existing on-prem servers.

## On-Premise vs Cloud
- On-premise servers are housed in the same location of work (In the same room or on another floor of the building).
- Cloud servers are stored at any of the data centres located worldwide, it can be in a different city, state, territory, or country.
- The cloud has a massive advantage over on-premise servers (due to limited architecture) when it comes to scalability and cost.
- If you need to increase the power or storage capacity of an on-premise system, you'll need to purchase and install new components.
- Components are costly and require specialized staff to install, update (monthly, quarterly, yearly) and maintain.
- Example: Suppose there is a sudden surge in the data volume, ordering new components and resources can take from several days to months,
- This means the companies might not be able to get the components they need before their maximum capacity is reached.
- They'll also stuck with the components they purchased, even if the increased demand for computing was temporary.

Factors | On Premises | Cloud
:--- | :--- | :---
Scalability | Limited by physical infrastructure, requires purchasing and installing hardware | Easy to quickly scale resources based on demand.
Cost | High initial investments in equipment. High overhead cost (maintenance, upgrades, staff) | No or minimal initial investment. Lower overhead cost.
Security | More secure due to lack of internet endpoints, security is managed in-house | Internet endpoints increase risks, and security is mostly outsourced by third parties.
Reliability | Natural disasters pose great risks, resilient to internet disruptions | Resilient to natural disasters, lack of internet disrupts access and usage. Data is backed up at multiple servers at different locations.

### **Who uses the cloud? Data Roles and Cloud**

1. Business and Data Analyst
- Primarily end users/consumers of cloud platforms. They work with databases and software hosted in the cloud.
- But don't need to understand the underlying architecture.

2. Data Scientists
- Primary end users, but occasionally need to develop cloud architecture for ETL tasks.
- They often access additional data sources using API and develop, build and deploy ML models in the cloud.

3. Analytics Engineers
- Must be comfortable working with cloud architecture and platforms.
- They help to optimize the cloud infrastructure built by Data Engineers for the use of Data Analysts and Data Scientists.

4. Data Engineers
- Responsible for developing and optimizing cloud infrastructure for other data roles.
- They centralize data into data lakes, build data pipelines, and transition cloud infrastructure to emerging tools and technologies.
